  "description": "The online demonstration is running at [JS-monads-stable](http://schalk.net:3055) is functioning reliably. The monads are in the /client/src directory in a file named `monad.js`. The code is at [https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable](https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable). `monad.js` is referenced in a script in the index.html file of the online demonstration. The application front end uses Motorcycle.js. The backend is a Haskell websockets server. The package here at npmjs.org is not working as I would like. I am trying to fix that. Any suggestions emailed to fpschalk@gmail.com would be much appreciated.",
