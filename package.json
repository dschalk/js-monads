An online demonstration is running at [JS-monads-stable](http://schalk.net:3055) The repository is for the demonstration is at [https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable](https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable). The entire JS-monads parts 1 through 5 online series is deprecated, not optimized, and uses older definitions of the monads, but it might be of some use. The demonstrations are available at [http://schalk.net](http://schalk.net). I am trying to make the NPM pachage useful, but am having trouble with MonadStream which import most-subject. I recently switched from browserify to webpack to see if that would make a difference. Version 2.1.13 has gone back to including some functions for the Monad bnd() method.",
