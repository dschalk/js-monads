# js-monads
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES - I am working on making this useful. 
The online demonstration running at [JS-monads-stable](http://schalk.net:3055) is functioning well. The code is at [https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable](https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable). /client/src/monad.js is referenced in a script in /client/index.html. I am attempting to made the code available in a module. Any suggestions emailed to fpschalk@gmail.com would be much appreciated.
