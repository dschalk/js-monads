The online demonstration running at [JS-monads-stable](http://schalk.net:3055) is functioning well. I plan to publish some tests soon. The code is at [https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable](https://github.com/dschalk/JS-monads-stable). /client/src/monad.js is referenced in a script in /client/index.html.
